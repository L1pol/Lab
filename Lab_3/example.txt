No regrets, no cries, no pain will ever
Touch my heart like blossoms touch a tree
Withering with autumn, I will never
Be the young man that I used to be

You, my heart, are slowing down already
As you’re freezing inch by inch inside
Barefooted, wild me — how upsetting! —
Won’t be running in the countryside

Wanderlust! my passion and my nature,
You don’t make me tremble with delight
Like you used to. Now I lost my features
Laughing eyes and feelings running wild

I don’t feel like having plans, desires
Did I have a life or did I dream?
I was merely chasing early sunrise
Rapid ride at dawn, that’s what it seemed.

We are mortal, we were born to perish
Copper leaves are falling with no sound
Once it came to blossom, to be cherished —
Blessed, returning to the silent ground.
